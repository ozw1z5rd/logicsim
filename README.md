# Logi(c)sim

Well actually the name is logisim ( no C ), however, logiCsim sounds much, much better.

Imported from sourceforge ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/ ) 
The author website: http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html

It is a wonderful software with documentation translated in several languages. I took it from sourceForge, where it has not been updated for over 10 years! I fixed to build script, not the best in truth, and it compiles ( tested under macOS ).
On sourceForge are also available the precompiled versions.

Now you can built it using: 

```
git clone https://github.com/ozw1z5rd/logicsim.git
cd logicsim
# tested with python 2.7
python scripts/create-jar.py
# run it from command line using
java -jar logisim-fragile-2.7.2.jar
```
